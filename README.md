# APS105_Labs
Lab work done as part of APS105 course in UofT

This was an Computer Fundamentals course taught in C. 
It started out slow but soon we were solving LeetCode hard and Medium level problems and writing an environment to play Othello with others and an AI to beat other AI in the game. 

We also went over Linked-List, Doubly Linked List, Binary Tress and all the sorting algorithms
